# Calculator GUI and Testing Project (Fall 2023)

This project consisted of a template which I was tasked to build a functional calculator GUI and testing functions upon. It was a great, beginner friendly, learning exercise in how to create and format GUI with Java Swing, connect them back to functionalities, and write tests for my code. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, and some scientific calculations.
